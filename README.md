 Here I am working on a couple of Capella MBSE projects.
 
File SPMCS: Solar Powered Mobile Charging System
File Smart_HEM_System: Smart Home Energy Management System

Both projects are yet to be completed. I needed help with the Smart HEM system, especially with the topics like wireless communication systems, Software automation, and data analysis.
